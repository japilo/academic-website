title: A great wasp adventure
---

I have a research plan for this field season, and it's totally different from what I did last year. I can't tell you how
excited I am. I'm going to go on a series of road trips up and down the Eastern Seaboard to look for paper wasps.

Why am I doing this? Well, I think that the social behavior of paper wasps may change in different parts of their range
here in North America. The only way to find out if that's true is to go out and observe wasps all over. So I'll be traveling from
North Carolina in the south to Canada in the north to observe and collect paper wasps in a range of different climates.

My first trip is coming up on March 14. I'll be driving down from Boston all the way to Raleigh, NC. Jim Hunt and other friendly
entomologists at North Carolina State University will help me find places where the wasps are starting to build their nests. Then
I'll drive my way north through Virginia, stopping along the way at farmhouses, where wasps like to build their homes. I'll be
back in Boston on March 22.
