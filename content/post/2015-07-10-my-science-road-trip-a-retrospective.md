title: My science road trip - a retrospective
---

For two and a half months, I've been on a road trip along the East Coast observing paper wasp nests for 
my research. Now I'm back home in Somerville, MA, and I can look back with pride on a job well done.

I put 8000 miles on my car, drove from North Carolina to Maine (that's 9 degrees of latitude!), and observed 345 nests
of 5 different paper wasp species. Here's a map of the sites I visited, color-coded by the species of paper wasp I found.

It's incredible to see two and a half months of hard work and adventure distilled down to a map like that. I've driven
to the tops of mountains, inspected changing rooms along the beach, spooked a herd of feral horses, and startled a whole lot of campers at strange hours
 of the morning. And, of course, I found wasps in all kinds of interesting places, from a news kiosk in Durham, NC 
 to the roof of my uncle's house in NY to a windy beach strewn with driftwood in Maine.

So what's next for me this summer? As you might imagine, I have a whole lot of data to analyze now. I've already started,
and let me say that what I've seen so far is very exciting. I also have a captive population of paper wasps to look after
and experiment on. I'll miss the adventure of the road trip, but it's also good to be back in the Tufts biology community.
I'll keep you all posted!
