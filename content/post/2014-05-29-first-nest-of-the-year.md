My intern Stephanie spotted the first wasp nests of the year on the weekend. The wasp you see perched on this nest
is one we call Little Red, because she has a small red paint mark right where her thorax meets her abdomen. This baby
nest has just one cell, a hexagon just like the ones you see in beehives, except that this one is made of wood pulp 
instead of wax. You can't see it from this angle, but Little Red, the foundress of this nest, lays an egg in each cell
 of the nest, so there's a tiny wasp egg there waiting to hatch.
 
What's interesting from a social perspective is that another wasp may join Little Red as a subordinate foundress and help her 
build the nest. If Little Red manages to attract a subordinate, her fellow foundress will do most of the work foraging for wood
pulp and food, leaving Little Red with more resources to lay her own eggs. It's also possible that another wasp will fight
Little Red and try to usurp her nest. I'll post updates as the social lives of my wasps unfold.
