title: My field schedule this year
---

I am planning out my schedule of field work this year, so here's how the summer's shaping up. The dates are not precise, 
because weather and other circumstances may shift my plans. If you live near any of the places on my itinerary and you know some places where you've seen wasp nests, contact me. 

## April

April 27 – 30: Richmond, VA

I will do preliminary surveys of the Richmond area for a few days, so I know where to go back and mark wasps and collect nests.

## May

May 1 – 30: Boyce, VA (near Charlottesville)

I will spend the month of May based out of UVA's Blandy Experimental Farm. Here I will survey for wasps, primarily in Northern VA,
mark some of them *in situ* so I can come back and find them later, and collect some of them for later analysis in the lab. I will
also make excursions from here to the Richmond / Williamsburg area and to Maryland. 

## June

May 31 – June 8: Western New Jersey

I need to bolster my sample sizes in the mid-Atlantic, so I'm spending a week in NJ, with perhaps a few days at the beginning or
end of this period in Philadelphia. There's a strong culture of organic farming around here I can take advantage of. Here's hoping I 
have better luck in NJ this year than I did last year.

June 9 – 16: Somerville, MA

I'll be back in Massachusetts for a week to hit up all my usual Eastern MA field sites. I expect this week to be very efficient since
I know exactly who to call and where to go when it comes to finding wasps around Boston.

June 17 – 25: Portland, ME

I'm spending a week here to revisit some good field sites from last year and hopefully add some great new ones. Again, I'll be observing,
marking, and sometimes collecting wasp nests. 

June 26 – 28: New York, NY

This is a short break from my fieldwork to celebrate my birthday with my family, break up the long trip from Maine to Virginia, 
and catch up on data entry / number crunching / sample organizing.

## July

June 29 – July 6: Boyce, VA

I will again be based out of Blandy Farm for this week, checking up on the nests I marked and surveyed in May. Again, there will
be excursions to the Richmond area and Maryland.

July 7 – 10: Western New Jersey

Again, a check up on my nests in NJ!

July 11 - 18: Somerville, MA

Back home for a while to check on my Massachusetts nests and take a bit of a breather.

July 19 – 25: Portland, ME

July 26 – 31: Somerville, MA

Brief break at the home and lab before my final survey trip.

## August

August 1 – 7: Boyce VA

August 8 – 13: Western NJ

August 14 - 18: Somerville, MA

August 19 – 23: Portland ME

August 23 – : Somerville, MA
