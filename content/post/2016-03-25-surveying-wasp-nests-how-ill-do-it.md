title: Surveying wasp nests - how I'll do it
---

I've been taking some time to think deeply about how to collect the data I'll need for my project
about geographic variation in cooperative breeding in Northern paper wasps, and I thought I'd share with you all my
current plan.

When I pick out a field site, I'll go there four times during the spring and summer. The first time will be in late
April / early May. I'll need to visit the site twice. The first time is to survey for nests, which I can do at any time of day. The only equipment I'll bring is a pair of binoculars, a laser rangefinder, and a ladder to get a better look at nests if I need to. The amount of time this takes depends on the size of the property; it takes ten minutes to survey a small barn, took me eight hours to survey all of the buildings in Acadia National Park.

Assuming I find nests at the site, I will then do a second visit, which needs to happen in the early morning, ideally 4 am but I can do it later in the morning, as long as it's before 8 am. Some of the nests I will collect and freeze, and some I will keep in situ and mark the wasps with paint so I can identify them later. The equipment I bring with me for that is a ladder, a wheeled cooler, paint, and forceps for grabbing the wasps with.

I need to do three follow-up visits in June, July, and August. For those I only need one visit because I know where the nests are and I don't need to survey for them, but the visit does have to be early morning. For the June and July visits all I'll do is visit and observe, no equipment. For the August visit I'll collect again, with my ladder and cooler, and round up all the reproductive females produced on the nest this year.
