title: How my research applies to humans (if at all)
---

One of the more common questions I get from people when I tell them that I study cooperative behavior in paper wasps is whether my research
can teach us something about cooperative behavior in humans. My first thought is always that I, personally, don't really care whether it 
applies to humans or not. That's not the reason I got into this field. At this point, we don't even fully understand why [social amoebas](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/compound-eye/starving-to-be-social-the-odd-life-of-dictyostelium-slime-molds/) cooperate
with one another, so to me it seems that the goal of understanding why humans cooperate in the ways we do is a very long way off.

But I usually don't say that first thought out loud, because I don't want to dismiss people's desire to turn to other animals to learn more
about our own species. That desire drives a lot of good scientists to do good research, and gets a lot of lay people interested in animal behavior.
I want to encourage that.

I think it's easiest to explain how my research contributes to understanding human society by employing a simile to another field of biology:
cancer research. When people donate money to cancer research, they often imagine that the money goes directly to developing new cancer drugs.
And sometimes it does. But a lot of cancer research would look to a lay person like it doesn't have anything to do with cancer at all. Lots of
cancer research is done on DNA replication and repair proteins in yeast. Yeasts don't even /get/ cancer. But this research is still crucial to
understanding how cancer works in humans, because cancer is fundamentally cell replication gone out of control. It happens when replication
mechanisms in the cell go awry, and those mechanisms go awry when mistakes in the genetic code don't get properly repaired. The genes in yeast
that control DNA replication and repair are actually quite similar to ours â€“ which is why biologists do cancer research on organisms that don't
get cancer.

The social life of a paper wasp is very different from yours or mine. But there are very simple mechanisms that influence their social lives that
also influence ours, such as aggression, discrimination, and nepotism toward relatives. I'm pretty sure that if we don't understand how these 
mechanisms work in wasps, whose societies are much simpler than ours, we have no hope of understanding them in people.
