I've been in the South doing fieldwork for over a week now, so I thought I'd update you all on how it's going.

I've visited farms, state parks, and abandoned buildings from Richmond to the outer suburbs of Washington. A quick glance
through my field notebook tells me that I've observed over a hundred paper wasp nests in Virginia. Not a single one has
been *P. dominula*, the invasive paper wasp of special interest to my research. But I've been taking notes on every nest
I see, and the Northern paper wasp *P. fuscatus* turns out to be common here as well as in Massachusetts, so I'm excited
to compare nesting behavior between the two regions once I get all these data entered.

In an hour or two I'll be in Washington, D.C. I know there are European paper wasps there because I had a look at the collections
at the Smithsonian on my way down from Boston. There are some lovely state parks in D.C. where I'll be poking my nose (and my forceps).
Then I'll spend a couple of days in Baltimore to sample some Maryland paper wasps. Wish me luck!
