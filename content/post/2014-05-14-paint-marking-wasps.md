title: Paint-marking wasps

The bread and butter of my research is behavioral observation. My undergraduate helpers and I write down what 
the wasps are doing and when they're doing it. But to do this, we have to be able to tell the wasps apart. 
While the wasps have no problem telling each other apart, it's not so easy for us humans. So researchers of social 
insects solve this problem by paint-marking the wasps.

Each of the wasps in my study enclosure has a two- or three-color code on the back of its thorax. But painting 
them isn't simple. First you have to catch them, then you have to paint them while they're squirming around 
trying to get away from the forceps, as you can see in this picture.

This year so far, I've been doing the capturing, while my undergraduate helper Kei Thurber has done the 
paint-marking. After much experimentation, we found that toothpicks and oil paints work best. Little did the 
store employees at the art store know what I had planned for this oil paint set.
