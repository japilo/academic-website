![Little Red with subordinate](/static/posts/R1.jpg)

Remember [Little Red](/2014/05/29/first-nest-of-the-year/ "First nest of the year")? She's attracted a subordinate foundress! The wasp on the right is Little Red, and the one on the left facing the camera is Yellow Pink. She joined nest R1 a week or two after it was founded. As the subordinate foundress, she can be seen off the nest more often than Little Red, because the tasks of foraging for wood pulp to build the nest and caterpillars to feed the young fall to her. This gives Little Red more time to build the nest, lay eggs, and tend to the young. 

Nests with multiple foundresses are more productive than nests with a single foundress. So why aren't all nests multiple foundress? That's because dominant foundresses lay more eggs than single foundresses, but subordinate foundresses lay much fewer. So the real question, and the one that fascinates me the most, is why subordinate foundresses join up with dominants, giving up the chance to lay more eggs themselves. 

I think it may have to do with the opportunities available to found a nest alone. It's not always easy, and many foundresses fail. In a harsh environment, it may be too difficult to found a nest without help, so some foundresses join up with others instead of taking the risk of building a nest alone. In half of my captive population, I've created a harsh environment by giving them the bare minimum of food they need. I'm observing what the wasps do in response. Nest R1 is in the more forgiving environment, so these two have as much food as they could wish, but there are other factors that could limit opportunities for single founding.
