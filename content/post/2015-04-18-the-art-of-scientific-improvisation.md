title: The art of scientific improvisation

It's only 9:25 p.m. as I write this post, but I assure you that I feel as tired as if it were midnight. I've had
a very busy time on my fieldwork expedition. I left Boston on Tuesday afternoon, arrived in Raleigh, NC on Wednesday in
the late afternoon, and I've been waking up at 5:15 am every morning since, against my natural inclinations.

In war, they say that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy. The same is true for fieldwork. No matter how well
you plan in advance, it never goes as you expected once you get out there. Reality smacked me upside the head when I went
out and looked for nests here. I've found 36 nests so far, and not a single one has been a European paper wasp. This is 
good news for North Carolina, since as far as I can tell they're invasive wasp-free, but bad news for my collection plans.

Fieldwork is improvisational. When your plan inevitably falls through, you have to patch it up in the moment as best you can.
My new plan is to take notes on all the paper wasps I see, continue traveling northward, and try to figure out where the
southern invasion front of the European paper wasp lies. My next stop on the journey north is Williamsburg, VA. Wish me luck!
