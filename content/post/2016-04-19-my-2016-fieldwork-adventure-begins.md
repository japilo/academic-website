title: My 2016 fieldwork adventure begins
---

I'm driving to Virginia on Friday, where I'll be staying at the University of Virginia's Blandy Experimental Farm for three weeks. 
Here's a map of all the sites where I hope to search for wasps during my stay.

Starting on Sunday, I will wake up around 4 a.m. every morning to go out and search for wasp nests at farms, stables, and parks. Thanks to the
good folks at [Virginia Working Landscapes](http://www.vaworkinglandscapes.org/), I already have most of my first week scheduled. Tune in
to my Twitter for day-to-day updates on the status of my research.
