title: Wasp adventure itinerary

On Saturday, I'm heading out with my cooler, my bee suit, my ladder, my forceps, and a few changes of clothes so I can find some
paper wasps in Virginia and North Carolina. Here's a map of my trip.

Because the weather has been unusually cold in the South just as it has been in the North, I am concentrating my efforts in North
Carolina, where the temperatures have been above 60ยบF more often than not. (I think on this wistfully in Boston, which only broke 60ยบ
yesterday, only to plunge back down to freezing today.) My contacts at NCSU have some sites for me to search, and I've been calling
organic farmers all around the Research Triangle to get permission to search for wasps on their farms, just like I've done here in
Massachusetts.

I've also gotten some great support from family friends in Virginia, though, and while I'm not really expecting to find wasp nests
when there's still snow on the ground, I'll hopefully scope out some sites that'll be likely candidates for my next trip.

It's been fun reaching out to farmers and the folks I'm staying with in the South, teaching them more about the wasps in their area.
Planning this trip hasn't been easy, but in two days I'll finally hit the road!
