Last time I set out, I went to North Carolina and Virginia. This time, I will return to Virginia, and add
DC and Maryland to my list.

My first stop on my way south is to the Smithsonian in DC so I can have a look at their wasp collection. The collection
sites recorded for my species, *Polistes dominula*, will guide my search. I've already looked at some records online,
which confirm that the European paper wasp has been seen in Richmond, VA, as well as Washington DC and Maryland.

I will then return to Richmond to try to actually find *P. dominula*, which I didn't manage last time. I'll also
spend some time in Charlottesville and northern Virginia on the hunt. I don't expect to get a lot of nests, but I hope to
find at least a few. Finally, I will spend three days in Maryland, where I expect to find more nests, based on the online records I have already
seen.
