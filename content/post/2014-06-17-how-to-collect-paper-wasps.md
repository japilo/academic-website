Here's a picture of me collecting wasps from [Drumlin Farm](http://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/drumlin-farm "Drumlin Farm"), a property of the Massachusetts Audubon Society. The picture was taken at 5:30 am, which represents the tail end of the collection trip, not the beginning. You see, the key to collecting paper wasps without getting stung is to begin your collection at 3:30 am, as my research assistant and I did that morning. 

The tools of the trade are a cooler, a ladder, a flashlight, ziploc bags, and forceps. Wasps like to nest in elevated spots, so the ladder comes in handy. The flashlight is definitely needed at 3:30 am, though it's best not to point it directly at the nest, since it will alert the wasps that I'm coming. As shown here, I come at the nest with the forceps in my left hand and drop it into the ziploc bagin my right. By the time the wasps know what's happening, I've already closed the ziploc on them.

It's also important to stay calm if anything goes wrong. I've dropped wasps before. But they only view you as a threat if you move quickly and, well, threateningly. So if any wasps get loose, I just stand still on my ladder and wait for them to fly away. If you encounter any paper wasps and you're afraid, I recommend you do the same. Flinching away or running only upsets them further.
