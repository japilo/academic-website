title: Pre-founding wasp behavior
---

{{< youtube dbskLTQjCnU >}}


Paper wasps are currently in the pre-founding life stage. What you can see in the video above are queens who have sperm stored from last year, ready to fertilize their eggs and start laying. They're out of hibernation for the spring, but there isn't quite enough food available yet to feed their offspring, so they haven't built nests yet. So what are they doing?

This is the phase in their lives when the wasp queens size each other up. It is thought that the social interactions they have now are critical in determining who they cooperate with later. So my intern Kei, who recorded this video, and I are watching their social interactions to see how well they predict what happens after they build their nests.

The wasps in this video are hanging out in a gap between the wall and the ceiling, which is all very well for them, but pretty annoying for a couple of shortish women trying to observe them!
