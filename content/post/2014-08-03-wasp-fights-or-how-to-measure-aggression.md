title: Wasp fights! Or, how to measure aggression
---

{{< youtube Jg_7kWtUeX8 >}}

One of my projects this summer is to measure differences in aggression towards nestmates and non-nestmates in
paper wasps. It's well known that social insects are aggressive towards members of other social groups. What I want
to find out is whether this type of aggression changes over the course of the year. I measure aggression by putting
wasps from the same or different nests in boxes and watching them fight. The video above is a highlight reel from
one of these aggression trials. Can you tell which wasp is from a different nest from the others?
